A few more corrections


Change the program to display the following text: "Coding in Java". Use variables.


Requirements:
1.	Three variables must be declared.
2.	All variables must be assigned a value immediately after they are declared.
3.	You can&#39;t change the screen output command.
4.	The program should display &quot;Coding in Java&quot;.
