Returning a stack trace


Write five methods that call each other. Each method must return its stack trace.


Requirements:
1.	There should be 5 methods in the class (in addition to the main method).
2.	Each method should call the next: main calls method1, method1 calls method2, etc.
3.	Each method must return its stack trace.
4.	To get a stack trace, use Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace().
